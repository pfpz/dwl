	<ins><b><h3><i>How it started;</i></h3></b></ins>
	<p><h4><b><mark>In March and April of 2021, Russia built up it's forces near the Russia-Ukraine border, and once more built up forces again between the Russian-Belarusian border during October of 2021 and February of 2022.</mark> The Russian government multiple times denied being involved or partaking in any invasions or attacks against Ukrain after being asked by officials and the press. The decision to invade Ukraine was reportedly made by Putin and a small group of War-Hawks/Siloviki in Putin's most inner-circle, including National Security Adviser Nikolai Patrushev and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu. During the second build-up, Russia demanded that NATO end all activity in Eastern Europe and ban Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining NATO. Russia threatend an unspecified military response if NATO followed their "aggressive line". A treaty to prevent Ukraine from joining would go against NATO's Open Door Policy, despited NATO's unenthusiastic response to Ukrainian requests to join. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that "Russia has no say" on whether Ukraine join, and that "Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neigbors." NATO's official policy is that it does not seek confrontation, and NATO and Russia had co-operated until Russia annexed Crimea. NATO offered to improve communications with Russia to discuss missile placements and military exercises, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine's borders, but Russia did not do so. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz both made efforts in February of 2022 to prevent a war from accuring. Macron met with Putin but failed to dissuade him from the invasion. Scholz warned Putin of heavy sanctions that would be imposed, should he invade, and told Zelenskyy to declare a neutral state and renounce its aspirations to join NATO. Zelenskyy replied that Putin could not be trusted to uphold to such an agreement. </b></h4></p>

	<ins><b><h3><i>When the attack started;</i></h3></b></ins>
	<p><h4><b>On February 21, 2022, Putin announced Russian diplomatic recognition of the Russian-conrolled territories of Ukraine as independent states: The Donestk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. The following day, February 22, 2022, Russia announced that it was sending troops into these territories as "peacekeepers", and the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force abroad. <mark> Before 5 AM on February 24, 2022, Putin in another speech had announced, a "special military operation", which "effectively declared war on Ukraine".</mark> Putin said the operation was to "protect the people" of the Russian-controlled breakaway republics. He falsely claimed that they had "been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime." Putin had also falsely claimed that Ukrainian government officials were Neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons and that NATO was building up military infastructure in Ukraine to threaten Russia. He said Russia sought the "demilitarisation and denazification" of Ukraine. <mark>Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine and supported the right of the Ukrainian people to self-determination. Russian missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine, and Russian troops invaded the north, east, and south.</mark> Reports of an alleged leak of Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) documents by US intelligence sources said that the FSB had not been aware of Putin's plan to invade Ukraine.</b></h4></p>

	<ins><b><h3><i>Summed up;</i></h3></b></ins>
	<p><h4><b>The invasion, described as the biggest attack on a European country since the Second World War, began at dawn on February 24, 2022. Russia launched a simultaneous ground and air campaign, commencing air and missile strikes across Ukraine, with some rockets reaching as far west as Lviv. It is Russia's largest combined arms operation since the Battle of Berlin in 1945. Fighting began in Luhansk Oblast at 3:40 AM near Milove on the border with Russia. The main infantry and tank attacks were launched in four spearheads, creating a northern front launched towards Kyiv from Belarus, a southern front from Crimea, a southeastern front from Russian-controlled Donbas, and an eastern front from Russia towards Kharkiv and Sumy. Russian vehicles were subsequently marked with a white Z military symbol (a non-Cryrillic letter) believed to be a measure to prevent friendly fire.</b></h4></p>
